TODO:
- write some doc and comments

- ajust INPUT_MAX_LEN in utils.h to match the new input's max
- echo $? now always print 42 (temporary)
- change HISTFILE to ~/.42sh_history
- line edition
	- FIX : ctrl+c when autocomp
	- IMPROVE : using arrow keys when autocomp should move in choices and not history
- options of echo builtin ? (not posix but could be good)
- fancy prompt
- parsing
