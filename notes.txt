TODO:

- echo $? now always print 42 (temporary)
- fancy prompt
- parsing
- line edition
	- IMPROVE : using arrow keys when autocomp should move in choices and not history
	- LEAKS!
	- check crash & leaks if BASIC line edition enabled (no termcaps)
	- secure the window resize by getting the win resize signal
	- secure the scrolling (ex : disable writing when the command line goes above the window size)
- options of echo builtin ?
- signals?
- shortcuts (ex: CTRL + L)
