TODO:
- write some doc and comments
- should I lex amp (&) symbol since we dont use it ?
- ajust INPUT_MAX_LEN in utils.h to match the new input's max
- echo $? now always print 42 (temporary)
- fancy prompt
- parsing
- line edition
	- IMPROVE : using arrow keys when autocomp should move in choices and not history
	- LEAKS!
- options of echo builtin ?
- signals?
- shortcuts (ex: CTRL + L)
- / and unmatched quotes (', "") should ask for a line of input
- display command line when error (command: no such builtin)
- globals in line_edit.h > remove it and if we REALLY need to keep one, move the declarations to global.h
- use the new env in line edition
- FIX empty line exits the shell
- copy-paste functionality?
- should we make autocompletion compatible with CDPATH?
