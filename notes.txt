TODO:
- write some doc and comments
- should I lex amp (&) symbol since we dont use it ?
- ajust INPUT_MAX_LEN in utils.h to match the new input's max
- echo $? now always print 42 (temporary)
- fancy prompt
- parsing
- line edition
	- IMPROVE : using arrow keys when autocomp should move in choices and not history
- options of echo builtin ?
- signals?
- shortcuts (ex: CTRL + L)
- synchronize UP/DOWN arrow with new history system
- / should ask for a line of input
- display command line when error (command: no such builtin)
- globals in line_edit.h > remove it and if we REALLY need to keep one, move the declarations to global.h

Error from acauchy's 21sh:
- strcmp in redirections !!!!! Change to libft's ft_strcmp
