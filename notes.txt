TODO:

- line edition
	- check crash & leaks if BASIC line edition enabled (no termcaps)
	- secure the window resize by getting the win resize signal
	- secure the scrolling (ex : disable writing when the command line goes above the window size)
- options of echo builtin ?
- signals?
- display command line when error (command: no such builtin)
- $? after a parse error should be 1
- REDIRECTIONS/STARTER
    - shorten pipeline_run fct in interpreter.c
    - shorten handle_pipes fct in interpreter.c
